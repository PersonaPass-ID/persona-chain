# PersonaPass Tokenomics System

## Overview

The PersonaPass tokenomics system is a comprehensive token economy designed to incentivize identity verification, governance participation, and long-term platform growth. The system centers around the **PID (PersonaID) token** and includes sophisticated staking, governance, and reward mechanisms.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **PersonaTokenomics.sol** - Main token contract with staking and rewards
2. **PersonaGovernance.sol** - DAO governance with staking-weighted voting
3. **PersonaStakingPools.sol** - Multi-pool staking with flexible rewards

## Token Economics

### PID Token Specifications
- **Name**: PersonaID Token (PID)
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 PID (1 billion)
- **Initial Supply**: 100,000,000 PID (100 million)
- **Token Standard**: ERC-20 with voting extensions (ERC20Votes)

### Token Distribution
- **Initial Circulation**: 10% (100M PID)
- **Staking Rewards**: 40% (400M PID) - vested over 5 years
- **Governance Treasury**: 25% (250M PID) - controlled by DAO
- **Team & Advisors**: 15% (150M PID) - 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
- **Ecosystem Development**: 10% (100M PID) - for partnerships and integrations

## Staking Mechanism

### Core Staking Features

- **Base APY**: 8% annually
- **Duration Bonus**: Up to 2% additional for max duration

#### 2. Enhanced Voting Power
Staking provides multiple benefits:
- **Governance Voting**: Staked tokens have enhanced voting power
- **Quadratic Scaling**: √(staked amount) to prevent whale dominance
- **Delegation Support**: Ability to delegate voting power
- **Participation Rewards**: Extra rewards for governance participation

#### 3. Multi-Signature & Timelock
- **Timelock Delays**: 24 hours for critical operations
- **Multi-Sig Support**: Enhanced security for large operations

### Voting Mechanisms

#### Enhanced Voting Power
Voting power = Token Votes + √(Staked Amount) + Delegated Votes

#### Quadratic Voting
- Available for Economic and Governance proposals
- Credits based on staked amount (1 credit per 1K PID)
- Vote weight = √(credits used)
- Prevents manipulation while allowing passionate participation
