## 💬 First Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Founder], and I built PersonaPass after watching too many customers abandon their carts when asked to upload an ID.

**The Problem**: Traditional age verification is broken
- 67% cart abandonment rate
- $2-5 per verification
- Privacy nightmares from storing IDs
- 5+ minutes to complete

**Our Solution**: Zero-knowledge age verification
- One-click process (<2 seconds)
- Just $0.05 per verification
- No personal data stored
- 73% conversion rate (3x improvement!)

**How it works**:
1. Customer clicks "Verify Age"
2. Connects their wallet
3. We generate a ZK proof of age
4. Done! They can checkout

We're already processing 1M+ verifications/month for merchants in alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and gaming.

**🎁 Product Hunt Exclusive**: 
- 50% off first 3 months
- Free white-glove onboarding
- Priority support
