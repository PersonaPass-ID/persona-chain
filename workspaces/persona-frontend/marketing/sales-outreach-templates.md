### Template 1: Problem-Focused (Alcohol/Wine)

**Subject**: Your wine shop is losing 67% of sales to ID verification

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Store Name] sells premium wines online. Quick question - how many customers abandon their cart when asked to upload an ID?

Industry data shows 67% of customers drop off at age verification. That's potentially $[X] in lost revenue every month for a store your size.

PersonaPass solved this for Premium Spirits Co - they went from 23% to 73% checkout completion. That's 3x more sales from the same traffic.

Our one-click verification:
- Takes <2 seconds (vs 5+ minutes)
- Costs $0.05 (vs $2-5 per check)
- Requires no ID upload
- Stores zero personal data

Would you be interested in a 10-minute demo? Happy to show you exactly how much revenue you could recover.

We're offering 50% off for new merchants this month.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 2: Success Story (Vape/Tobacco)

**Subject**: How VapeNation saves $20K/month on age verification

Hi [Name],

VapeNation was spending $25,000/month on age verification and losing 70% of customers at checkout.

Now they pay $1,250/month and convert 73% of visitors.

They switched to PersonaPass - one-click age verification that actually works:
✓ Customers verify in <2 seconds
✓ No ID uploads or personal data storage  
✓ Just $0.05 per verification
✓ Shopify integration took 10 minutes

[Store Name] could see similar results. Based on your traffic, you're likely losing $[X]/month in abandoned carts.

Free to try for 14 days. Want me to show you the ROI calculator?

### Template 3: Compliance Angle (Cannabis)

**Subject**: State-compliant age verification without the friction

Hi [Name],

Running a cannabis e-commerce store means walking a tightrope between compliance and conversion.

Traditional age verification:
- Scares away 67% of legitimate customers
- Costs $2-5 per check
- Creates privacy liability
- Still doesn't prevent fraud

PersonaPass is different:
- Full compliance with state regulations
- One-click verification (<2 seconds)
- Zero personal data stored
- 95% cheaper at $0.05/verification

[Competitor Store] increased their conversion rate by 3x after switching. 

Can I send you a quick case study? Takes 2 minutes to read.

Best,
[Your Name]

## 📱 Cold Call Script

**Opening** (10 seconds)
"Hi [Name], I know you're busy so I'll be quick. I'm calling because [Store Name] is likely losing 67% of sales at age verification. I help merchants recover that revenue. Do you have 30 seconds for me to explain?"

**If Yes - Problem** (20 seconds)
"Perfect. When customers have to upload their ID to buy [wine/vape/etc], 67% abandon cart. For a store your size, that's roughly $[X] in lost revenue every month. Plus you're paying $2-5 per verification."

**Solution** (20 seconds)
"PersonaPass does one-click age verification. No ID upload. Takes 2 seconds. Costs just 5 cents. VapeNation tripled their conversion rate using us."

**Close** (10 seconds)
"I can show you exactly how much revenue you'd recover in a 10-minute screenshare. Do you have time Thursday at 2, or would Friday morning work better?"

**Objection Handlers**:
- "We already have verification" → "Is it converting above 30%? Most don't. We guarantee 70%+ or you pay nothing."
- "Too expensive to switch" → "Integration takes 10 minutes. You'll make back any costs in the first week from recovered sales."
- "Privacy concerns" → "We store zero personal data. It's actually more private than current solutions."
